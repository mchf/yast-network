module Y2Network
  # A container for network devices. In the end should implement methods for mass operations over
  # network interfaces like old LanItems::find_dhcp_ifaces.
  #
  # @example Create a new collection
  #   eth0 = Y2Network::Interface.new("eth0")
  #   collection = Y2Network::InterfacesCollection.new(eth0)
  #
  # @example Find an interface using its name
  #   iface = collection.by_name("eth0") #=> #<Y2Network::Interface:0x...>
  class InterfacesCollection
    # Objects of this class are able to keep a list of interfaces and perform simple queries
    # on such a list.
    #
    # @example Finding an interface by its name
    #   interfaces = Y2Network::InterfacesCollection.new([eth0, wlan0])
    #   interfaces.by_name("wlan0") # => wlan0
    #
    # @example FIXME (not implemented yet). For the future, we are aiming at this kind of API.
